# so_long

This project is my first graphic project.
Using the X-Window API in C <a href="https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux">Minilibx</a> I made a small 2D game and it was also my first game ever :smiley:.<br> I used my favorite cartoon when I was a kid as theme for the game. Hope you enjoy it!
