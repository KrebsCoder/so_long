# so_long

This project is my first graphic project.
Using the X-Window API in C <a href="https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux">Minilibx</a> I made a small 2D game and it was also my first game ever :smiley:.<br> I used my favorite cartoon when I was a kid as theme for the game. Hope you enjoy it!

### Obs: I have created two maps, but you can also create your own maps

Rules that need to be followed in order to your new map be valid:

- The map must contain at least 1 exit, 1 collectible, and 1 starting position.
- The map must be rectangular.
-  The map must be closed/surrounded by walls.
- The map can be composed of only these 5 characters:
	- 0 for an empty space,
	- 1 for a wall,
	- C for a collectible,
	- E for a map exit,
	- P for the playerâ€™s starting position.


#### Example of valid map:


```
1111111111111
1001000000C01
1000011111001
1P0011E0000K1
1111111111111
```
