# Get Next Line - GNL

This project is part of √©cole 42 projects.

## üóíÔ∏è About

```get_next_line(int fd)``` function read from a file descriptor and print on the screen the result with the ```\n``` if there is any.<br>
The ```read``` function, from unistd.io library, read a certain amount of bytes from the passed file descriptor. These bytes are passed as BUFFER_SIZE at the compile time.<br>
The **expected behaviour** is that the function must read and return BUFFER_SIZE bytes until a ```\n``` or end of file (EOF), and must keep remaining bytes (if there is any) for a possible second call (or many other calls until EOF).

## ‚å®Ô∏è How to compile it

```clang -D BUFFER_SIZE=5 get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c main.c -I. && ./a.out```

- The get_next_line.c has the main function.
- The get_next_line_utils.c has auxiliary functions.
- The get_next_line.h has the header with the prototypes of utils.
- main.c has the test.
- -D means that you want to define a macro named...
- BUFFER_SIZE macro determines how many bytes the read function will read from a file descriptor (if = 0 the return value will be null).
- ```I.``` include where is the .h header (in this case, at the same directory that the others). If ommited then you have to write the get_next_line.h file.

## ‚≠ê Bonus part

GNL version 10 hasn't many bonus part. The instructions are:

- Read from various file descriptors at the same time.
- Use only one static variable.

The standard code already has the bonus part included, it was write considering the above rules.
